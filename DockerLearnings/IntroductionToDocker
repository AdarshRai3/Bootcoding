Introducion to docker 
-Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.
-Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.   
-Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run an application, so they can be run on any machine that has Docker installed.
-Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but share the OS kernel. This makes them more efficient than traditional virtual machines, which require a full OS for each instance.
-Containers are portable and can be run on any machine that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying OS or hardware.
-Containers are easy to scale and can be started or stopped in seconds, making them ideal for microservices and cloud-native applications.
-Containers are also easy to manage and can be orchestrated using tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Amazon ECS.
-Containers are not a replacement for virtual machines, but rather a complement to them. They can be used together to create a hybrid environment that takes advantage of the strengths of both technologies.
