4>IndentationError : it is the error which occurs when we do not follow the indentation properly in python.

5>AttributeError : it is the error which occurs when we try to access an attribute of an object which does not exist.

from importlib import reload
reload(module_name)
now you can acces the changes in the shell by using module_name.function_name() and module_name.variable_name
