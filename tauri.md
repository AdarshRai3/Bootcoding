Absolutely! Since you now want a 50-hour learning plan, we can go much deeper. This plan will cover Rust fundamentals → Advanced Rust → Cargo → Tauri 2.0 → Frontend integration → System design and best practices → Capstone projects. It’s structured so you progressively gain expert-level skills in building production-ready Tauri apps.

I’ll break it down hour by hour, grouping related topics.

50-Hour Rust + Cargo + Tauri 2.0 Learning Plan

match statements with patterns

Ranges and iterators

Exercise: FizzBuzz 1–50, pattern match days of the week.

Hours 5–6 — Ownership & Borrowing

Ownership rules

Borrowing (&) and mutable references (&mut)

Moves vs copies

Slices

Exercise: Write function modifying a string via mutable reference.

Hours 7–8 — Structs, Enums, and Pattern Matching

Struct definitions

Tuple structs & unit structs

Enums and variants

Pattern matching on enums and tuples

Exercise: Implement a Shape enum with Circle, Rectangle, calculate area/perimeter.

Hours 9–10 — Collections & Iterators

Vectors, HashMaps, HashSets

Iterators and iterator adaptors

filter, map, collect

Exercise: Count word frequency in a sentence, manipulate vector elements.

Hours 11–12 — Functions, Modules, and Error Handling

Function syntax, return types

Modules (mod, pub)

Result, Option, ? operator

Exercise: Read a file, return Result<String, io::Error>.

Phase 2 — Cargo & Crates (Hours 13–18)
Hours 13–14 — Cargo Essentials

cargo new, cargo build, cargo run, cargo check

cargo test, cargo doc --open

Workspace setup for multi-package projects

Exercise: CLI app “Hello Tauri”

Hours 15–16 — Crates & Dependencies

Adding dependencies (serde, rand, tokio)

Features & versioning

Using external crates in multiple modules

Exercise: Serialize/deserialize JSON

Hours 17–18 — Traits & Generics

Define and implement traits

Generic structs and functions

Trait bounds

Exercise: Printable trait for multiple structs; generic function that sums numeric collections.

Phase 3 — Advanced Rust (Hours 19–26)
Hours 19–20 — Lifetimes

Basic lifetime annotations

Function lifetimes

Struct lifetimes

Exercise: Fix a lifetime compilation error in function returning references.

Hours 21–22 — Advanced Error Handling

Custom errors

thiserror crate

anyhow crate for simplified error handling

Exercise: Build file parsing function with proper error reporting.

Hours 23–24 — Async & Concurrency

async fn and .await

tokio runtime

tokio::spawn and task management

Channels for communication

Exercise: Fetch multiple URLs concurrently using async tasks.

Hours 25–26 — Smart Pointers & Interior Mutability

Box, Rc, Arc, RefCell, Mutex

Shared ownership and thread-safe mutability

Exercise: Threaded counter using Arc<Mutex<i32>>

Phase 4 — Tauri 2.0 Basics (Hours 27–33)
Hours 27–28 — Setup & Hello World

Node.js + npm + Tauri CLI

npm create vite + npx tauri init

Run dev server and Tauri dev

Exercise: Display a “Hello Tauri 2.0” message.

Hours 29–30 — Commands & Rust–JS Communication

#[tauri::command]

invoke from frontend JS

Pass arguments, return values

Exercise: Counter button that calls Rust function and returns value.

Hours 31–32 — File System & State

Tauri API for reading/writing files

Global app state with State and Mutex

Exercise: Notes app: save/load text from Rust backend.

Hour 33 — Window & Event Management

Multiple windows

emit / listen for frontend events

Window events (resize, close, focus)

Exercise: Main + settings window; notify main window on settings change.

Phase 5 — Tauri + Frontend Integration (Hours 34–41)
Hours 34–35 — Frontend Framework

React/Vue/Svelte with Tauri

Components, props, state management

Exercise: Display notes list fetched from Rust backend.

Restrict filesystem and window access

Exercise: Limit app access to a specific directory.

Phase 6 — Best Practices & Advanced Features (Hours 42–47)
Hours 42–43 — Logging & Debugging

tracing crate

Hours 44–45 — Modular App Architecture

Separate modules for state, commands, windows

Clean project structure

Exercise: Refactor notes app into modules: state.rs, commands.rs, windows.rs

Hours 46–47 — Packaging & Cross-Platform Builds
