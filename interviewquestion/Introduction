First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Adarsh Rai, and I am an Engineering Graduate from the 2023 batch with a specialization in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, achieving a CGPA of 8.8. During my college years, I developed a keen interest in programming, which led me to pursue a career in software development.

After graduation, I joined Bootcoding as a Java Developer, where I gained hands-on experience working on live projects. I was responsible for building backend functionalities and utilities, which honed my skills in Java and Spring Boot.

Outside of work, I enjoy watching anime, which inspires me with its themes of perseverance and creativity. Thank you once again for this opportunity.
